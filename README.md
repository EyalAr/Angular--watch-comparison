# Performance comparison between different AngularJS's $watch types

For my [$watch Carefully](http://eyalarubas.com/watch-carefully.html) post.

0. [Deep watch example](http://eyalar.github.io/Angular--watch-comparison/deep-watch.html)
0. [watchCollection example](http://eyalar.github.io/Angular--watch-comparison/watch-collection.html)

The examples only differ in the watch method used in the `bxBoxes` directive.
Notice the huge performance difference.
