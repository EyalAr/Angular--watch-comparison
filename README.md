# Performance comparison between different AngularJS's $watch types

For my [blog post](http://eyalarubas.com/watching-data-in-angularjs.html) on the
same subject.

0. [Shallow watch example](http://eyalar.github.io/Angular--watch-comparison/shallow-watch.html)
0. [watchCollection example](http://eyalar.github.io/Angular--watch-comparison/watch-collection.html)
0. [Deep watch example](http://eyalar.github.io/Angular--watch-comparison/deep-watch.html)
0. [ngRepeat example](http://eyalar.github.io/Angular--watch-comparison/ng-repeat.html)

The examples only differ in the implementation of the `bxBoxes` directive, which
renders the colored boxes on the screen.

Notice the response time differences between the implementations.
